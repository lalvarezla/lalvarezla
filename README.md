## 📝 About me

I'm a Systems and Computing Engineering student at the National University of Colombia.

- 📚 I enjoy reading and playing chess — both help me stay curious and think strategically.  
- 🧠 I'm currently learning German.  
- 🧬 One of my biggest passions is biology. I'm fascinated by how life works at every level, from cells to ecosystems. Programming is another passion of mine, and I'm actively exploring how to blend both worlds — using code to understand, simulate, or even improve biological systems. I'm especially interested in fields like bioinformatics, computational biology, and health tech.
